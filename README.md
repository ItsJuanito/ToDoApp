Todo list in Flask(python)
# Master Folder
  - app.py: this is the main file that contains python source code. 
  - db.sqlite: this file contains the database information and all the attributes.
# Templates Folder
  - base.html: this file is the main file to run, contains Python formatted scripts and source code.
# __Pycache__ Folder
  - sets up the enviornment in order to run the program(but, I recommend running the program on linux).
